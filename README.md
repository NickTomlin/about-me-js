About

Programmatic about me access for yours truly.

Usage
---

```shell
npm i @nicktomlin/about
```

```javascript
let aboutNick = require('@nicktomlin/about')
console.log(`Nick is a ${aboutNick.occupation} at ${aboutNick.currentEmployer}`)
```

Why?
---

I wanted to play around with NPM scoped packages _and_ an easy way to pull my deets in for personal projects.
